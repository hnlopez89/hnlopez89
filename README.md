### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Pleased to receive your visit! Few information about me:

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working about **.Net**, **JavaScript** and their frameworks. Good proof of it are these projects:
- My web profile: made with **Vue.js** and pure **CSS** : [MyWebsite](https://hugotechandtravel.netlify.app/) [MyRepository](../../hnlopez89/profile).
- My first API based on **.Net** based on **Asp .Net**: [MyAPI](http://www.tasklisthnlopez.somee.com/swagger/index.html).
- A single journal App: made with **React**, **CSS** and using **Firebase** on the backend: [JournalApp](../../JournalApp).
- My first full stack project based on **Node.js**, **Vue.js**, **MySQL** and pure **CSS**:  [TempoVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOm7oJw7CuY) [TempoRepository](../../proyecto).

ðŸ“” My first approach to the software development was through the Bootcamp "Hack a Boss" during the pandemia of COVID-19, where I learned the basis of **JavaScript**.

ðŸ‘· Then, time to work! My experiences till now:
- **Junior Software Developer at TaskIt**:
- Adapting and updating a Warehouse Management System (WMS) made with **.Net** to the client Needs.
- Testing, documenting and puting in place the software itself on the warehouse facilities.

- **Junior Software Developer at 14Agency**:
- Creating a gallery of WebComponents made with **JavaScript** according to the corporative style and behaviour of our client **Seat** and **CUPRA**.
- Assisting on the execution of several sprints making the website of Movility Urban Solution by **Seat**, designed on **React.js**.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new challenges, let's work and keep building this story together!
